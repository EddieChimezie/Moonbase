# MOONBASE

A flutter app that focuses on the core building blocks that any app needs. This includes; **authentication**, **firebase** functionality for storing data, **bloc** and **cubits** for the state management and lastly **Light** and **Dark** mode functionality.

*Ps:* More functionalities would be committed to this app and ultimately be submitted to the apple app store.
